\paragraph{Abstract}
The management of privileged accounts is a key area of access and identity management. It can track and log activity of accounts with elevated privileges such as \texttt{root} on \textsc{Linux/UNIX} or \textsc{Windows} \texttt{Administrator}. This allows to recover a misconfiguration that caused a disruption of services, prevent intrusions by escalating privileges on the system, and monitor potential service providers in a large groups (outsourcing of maintenance service). Commercial solutions offer different approaches to the problem of privileged accounts. This internship has been the subject of a study of these different solutions, their functionalities and operation. This study allowed us to highlight three products: \textsc{Wallix AdminBastion}, \textsc{CyberArk Privileged Access Security Solution} and \textsc{Thycotic Secret Server}, to finally deploy in 2 proof of concept. This development has allowed us to go further in understanding the operation of the management of privileged accounts, treaties points and points requiring additional treatment to lower risk on privileges accounts.
